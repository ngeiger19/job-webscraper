# job-webscraper
A webscraper that gets and formats information from job postings and prints the info to the console.

I followed this tutorial: https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/ and I am adding to it for my own use.

The goal for this project is to pull relevent jobs, based on user input, from many different job sites and display them in one place. I would also like to create a GUI for both user input, and output after the script has run.
